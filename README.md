## Our Image Segmentation Framework
We conceived our framework to be able to handle both tensorflow-based models and torch-based models, as both are ubiquitous in the literature. To track our experiments, we used the MLFlow framework. Although it makes the code base a bit more complex, it allowed us to have a centralized space where we could log and **share** our experiments, model checkpoints, hyperparameters and so on. For hyperparameter tuning, we use [HyperOpt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/), a framework conceived to optimize hyper parameter searches.

The overall structure of the repository is described below.

pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
```

## Datasets

#### Available datasets
For reproducing our results, you do not need to setup a dataset folder, you 
just need to specify the dataset name in the command line when training and 
our framework will automatically download the relevant dataset. Available 
dataset names are:

>ðŸ“‹  TODO: Only keep the datasets that we need

> * original: dataset used in the ETHZ CIL Road Segmentation 2022 Kaggle competition
> * ext_original: "original" dataset, extended with 80 images scraped from Google Maps

procedure to avoid data leakage

#### Custom datasets
If you want to setup a custom dataset, simply place it in the 'dataset' folder,
with the following structure:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ dataset                   
    â””â”€â”€ <dataset-name>        
        â””â”€â”€ training
            â”œâ”€â”€ groundtruth
            â””â”€â”€ images
        â””â”€â”€ test
            â””â”€â”€ images
```

## Results

Our models achieve the following performance on the 'original' dataset:

| Model name         | F1-Score  | Weighted F1-Score |
| ------------------ |---------------- |------------------|
| UNet Exp  |     0.999         |          1         |
| Submission ensemble  |     0.998         |           1        |

Our model '<insert-name>' Achieved an F1-Score of <insert-score> on the Kaggle competition, granting us the `x'th` position on the Leaderboard.
